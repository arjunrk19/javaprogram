The Architecture of the Program:
 - The program works by obtaining the required information from the user through the command prompt.
 - The commands entered by the user is then split into its command portion and its "URL" portion.
 - This is then checked using a if-else if conditional loop.
 - The storeurl command causes the program to store the url value given after the command.
 - The URL is taken and converted into its Hash value.
 - This Hash value along with the URL is stored in a HashMap as key-value pairs.
 - This HashMap makes it easier for the user to retrieve data from the program.
 - In the get command, the hash of the stored URL is returned by using the URL as a key.
 - In the count command, the total iterations taken by the program is counted and returned.
 - In the list command,  the entire Hashmap is converted into a JSON Object.
 - This JSON Object is then returned in JSON format.
 - The exit command causes the program to terminate execution.
