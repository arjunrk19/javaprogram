This program has been written keeping in mind my limited view of both Java programming language and Computer Science 
core concepts such as Data Structures. The errors in the program are not intentional, but speaks of my lesser knowledge in Java.

Working Structure of Program:

1. storeurl google.com
2. google.com -> BAEA954B95731C68AE6E45BD1E252EB4560CDC45
3. {"google.com" : BAEA954B95731C68AE6E45BD1E252EB4560CDC45}  This is a HashMap. HashMap then retrieved using the key-value relationship for get command
5. count google.com : returns the itertative value, which depends on the program use.
6. list : prints the entire HashMap by converting it into JSON Object. This JSON Object is then returned for the user.
8. exit : exits the program
